# Eye-C-You
Eye C You: A Real-Time Eyelid Detection System for Preventing Driver Drowsiness Using Arduino and Python

Overview
The Drowsy Driving Detection System is a standalone Arduino-based safety solution designed to reduce road accidents caused by driver fatigue. By monitoring eyelid activity using an IR sensor or eye blink module, the system can detect signs of drowsiness such as prolonged eye closure. Upon detection, it immediately triggers a buzzer to alert the driver and potentially prevent an accident.

This solution is especially valuable in the Philippines, where long driving hours and lack of vehicle monitoring systems contribute to traffic-related fatalities.

Key Features

• Real-time detection of eye closure using an IR or eye blink sensor

• Arduino-controlled logic for quick and accurate response

• Audible buzzer alert to immediately wake the driver

• Adjustable sensitivity threshold for eye blink duration

• LED indicator for system status and detection feedback

Technology Used

• Arduino Uno or Nano

• Camera Module 

• Buzzer for audible warning

• LEDs for visual status indication

• Battery-powered or vehicle-powered setup

Use Cases
• Jeepney, taxi, and tricycle drivers
• Long-distance truck drivers
• Driving schools for safety training
• Personal vehicles used for frequent travel
